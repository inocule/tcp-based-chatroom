"# tcp-based-chatroom" 

Python TCP chatroom wherein a multithreaded server accepts clients, stores their sockets + usernames, broadcasts all messages, and announces joins/leaves. Each Tkinter‑based client picks a username, opens a simple GUI, sends raw text to the server, and displays every broadcasted line in a scrollable chat window.
